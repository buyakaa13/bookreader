# Design Patterns Showcase

This project provides a practical implementation of five fundamental Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Builder, and Adapter. Each pattern is implemented in a clear and concise way to help you understand its purpose and use case.

# ðŸš€ Design Patterns Included

##Book Reader (Singleton)

Only one main BookReader instance should exist (manages the current opened book).

Ensures consistent state across the app.

##Book Creation (Factory Method)

Books come in different formats: PDFBook, EPUBBook, MOBIBook.

Use a Factory to create the right book object depending on file type.

##UI Notifications (Observer)

When user flips a page, observers (UI components) update:

Progress bar updates

Current page number updates

Bookmark manager updates

##External Book Formats (Adapter)

Some books come from external libraries or APIs with different structures.

Use an Adapter to convert them into your appâ€™s Book interface.

##Custom Reading Preferences (Builder)

Build a ReaderSettings object (font size, theme, line spacing, background color).

Builder pattern makes it easy to customize step by step.

##ðŸ”— How it all works together

The Factory creates the right book format.

The Adapter makes sure even external/third-party books can be read.

The Singleton BookReader opens the book.

The Observer notifies UI parts when user interacts (page flip, bookmark, etc.).

The Builder helps users configure their reading preferences before starting.
